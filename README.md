# Hexo2Gridea
This project helps people migrate blog post from hexo to Gridea

# Background
When I was migrating the posts from Hexo to Gridea, it din't parse the post well and all the posts are missing from the page. So I created this little helper for anyone who wants to migrate it without any worries. 

# Usage
By simply replacing the HEXO_POST_DIR and GRIDEA_POST_DIR with your own dirs, this little tool would replace the the tags automatically for you for supporting the Gridea post format.
